                            nights and winters. One day some fire came off from a star and an old lady took it and kept it

                            herself,

                            a nice opossum offered people to bring them fire if humans promissed to stoped huntign
                            opossums.
                            Humans just laughed at it, but opossum went to the old lady's house and asked her to let him
                            to get close to the fire because it was very cold, and she agreed. When
                            opossum
                            was
                            close enough, put its tail in the fire and ran away to the humans keeping its word of
